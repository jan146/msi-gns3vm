# msi-gns3vm
Automated virtual machine creation with
<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant">Vagrant</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init">cloud-init</a>.<br>
The former allows you to provision fully functional virtual machine
with a preconfigured gns3 and remote desktop installation,<br>
whereas the latter allows you to do the same thing on a multitude of
cloud hosting providers 
(see the *Clouds* section of the 
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/availability.html">cloud-init docs</a> 
for an accurate list).
